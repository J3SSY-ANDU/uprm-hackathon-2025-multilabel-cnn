# UPRM Hackathon 2025: Multilabel CNN Image Classification

## Project Description
This repository contains the source code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based multilabel image classification project developed for the 2025 UPRM Hackathon, hosted in collaboration with Lockheed Martin. Our solution aims to demonstrate the power of deep learning in handling complex image datasets where each image may belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

## UPRM Hackathon & Lockheed Martin
The University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez (UPRM) Hackathon is an annual event that brings together student teams to solve real-world problems using technology and innovation. Sponsored by Lockheed Martin, the hackathon provides an excellent opportunity for students to tackle challenging engineering and computer science problems, gain hands-on experience, and network with industry professionals.

## CNN Multilabel Image Classification Purpose
Multilabel image classification enables a model to assign multiple tags or classes to a single image, which is essential for real-world scenarios such as object detection, medical imaging, and automated tagging systems. Our project leverages a CNN architecture to learn and predict multiple labels for each image, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Framework)
- NumPy, Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Preprocessing and Metrics)
- Jupyter Notebook (Development & Experimentation)
